### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Adarsh**](https://adarshmasekar.vercel.app/), a Software engineer based in India.

I love building practical, clean, and user-focused products. If something feels useful, I’ll probably build it — and ship it fast.

I work mainly with React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Framer Motion, and I enjoy designing in Figma. Recently, I’ve also been exploring backend systems, automation tools, and AI integrations to level up my full-stack skillset.

Currently, I’m working as a Junior Product Support Engineer, where I’ve developed a strong understanding of enterprise-level products, installation pipelines, databases, and automation frameworks like Qualitia Automation Studio.
